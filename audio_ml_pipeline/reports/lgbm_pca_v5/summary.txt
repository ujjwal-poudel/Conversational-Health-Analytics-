EXPERIMENT: V5: PCA on Wav2Vec2 (768→50) + Prosody
============================================================

Model: LightGBM

--- Feature Engineering Pipeline ---

  Step 1: Wav2Vec2 embeddings (768 dims per frame)
          -> PCA reduction (768 → 50 dims)
          -> Pool with 4 stats (mean, std, min, max)
          -> 50 × 4 = 200 features

  Step 2: Prosody features (13 dims per frame)
          -> F0, RMS, ZCR, spectral centroid/bandwidth/rolloff, contrast
          -> Pool with 4 stats (mean, std, min, max)
          -> 13 × 4 = 52 features

  Step 3: Concatenate
          -> 200 + 52 = 252 total features
