EXPERIMENT: V4 - Segment Pooling (Best Model)
============================================================

Model: XGBoost

--- Feature Engineering Pipeline ---

  Step 1: Audio Preprocessing
          -> Extract participant-only audio from DAIC-WOZ recordings
          -> Apply 300 Hz high-pass filter
          -> Output: Cleaned participant audio (.wav)

  Step 2: Wav2Vec2 Embedding Extraction
          -> Model: superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-er (emotion-tuned)
          -> Input: Participant audio (16kHz)
          -> Output: 768-dimensional embeddings per frame
          -> Chunked inference (20s chunks) with frame subsampling

  Step 3: Prosody Feature Extraction
          -> Pitch (F0) via YIN algorithm (50-400 Hz)
          -> Energy (RMS)
          -> Zero-crossing rate (ZCR)
          -> Spectral centroid, bandwidth, rolloff
          -> Spectral contrast (7 bands)
          -> Output: 13-dimensional features per frame

  Step 4: Segment Pooling (Temporal Dynamics)
          -> Split embeddings into 3 segments: Beginning / Middle / End
          -> For each segment, compute 4 statistics:
             - Mean, Std, Min, Max
          -> Wav2Vec2: 768 dims × 4 stats × 3 segments = 9,216 features
          -> Prosody:  13 dims × 4 stats × 3 segments = 156 features

  Step 5: Feature Concatenation
          -> 9,216 + 156 = 9,372 total features per participant

  Step 6: Model Training
          -> XGBoost with Optuna hyperparameter tuning
          -> 5-fold cross-validation on train+dev
          -> Final model trained on full train+dev set

--- Dataset Info ---
  Train samples: 107
  Dev samples: 35
  Test samples: 47
  Total features: 9,372

--- Cross-Validation (train+dev) ---
  Mean RMSE: 5.3846
  Std RMSE:  0.2353
  Fold RMSEs: [5.1650, 5.4247, 5.7848, 5.1285, 5.4200]

--- Test Set Performance ---
  RMSE: 5.9402
  MAE:  4.9265
  R²:   0.1394

--- Interpretation ---
  - Best performing model across all experiments
  - Only model with MAE < 5.0
  - Positive R² indicates model is learning meaningful patterns
  - Segment pooling captures temporal dynamics in conversation
