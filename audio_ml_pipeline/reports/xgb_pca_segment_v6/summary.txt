EXPERIMENT: V6: PCA (768→100) + Segment Pooling (3 segments)
============================================================

Model: XGBoost

--- Feature Engineering Pipeline ---

  Step 1: Wav2Vec2 embeddings (768 dims per frame)
          -> Model: superb/wav2vec2-base-superb-er (emotion-tuned)
          -> PCA reduction (768 → 100 dims)
          -> Segment pooling (3 segments: Begin/Mid/End)
          -> 4 stats per segment (mean, std, min, max)
          -> 100 × 4 × 3 = 1,200 features

  Step 2: Prosody features (13 dims per frame)
          -> F0, RMS, ZCR, spectral centroid/bandwidth/rolloff, contrast
          -> Segment pooling (3 segments: Begin/Mid/End)
          -> 4 stats per segment (mean, std, min, max)
          -> 13 × 4 × 3 = 156 features

  Step 3: Concatenate
          -> 1,200 + 156 = 1,356 total features
